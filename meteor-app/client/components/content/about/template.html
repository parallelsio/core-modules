      <h1>What is Make Parallels? (working title)</h1>

      <p>

      A proof of concept, for a free + open source tool helping storytellers of all kinds unlock their creativity. Easily weave together bits of media scattered across many services + devices into creative works, full of life. 
      </p>

      <p>
        We imagine one place to fluidly:
        
        <ul>
          <li>gather bits of inspiration scattered across the web </li>
          <li>remix + weave together these bit of media, in a freeform way</li>
          <li>move between these interactive creations, both privately and collaboratively</li>
          <li>navigate + share an interactive version history of the creative journey</li>
        </ul>
          
          
          
          
      </p>

      <p>
        This website demo is our engine for continual refinement: here we experiment with new ideas and test what works + what doesn't. 
        It's also your space to play and to follow our progress. 

      </p>

      <p>
        Many things are broken + incomplete: check back often, as daily and even hourly changes are common.

        We believe a system designed to enable flow leads to inspired play, which unlocks peak levels of creativity. Musicians describe these moments of flow, when their instrument “disappears”, allowing them to effortlessly play + discover breakthrough musical ideas. We see the same potential for digital storytellers. 
      </p>

      <p>
        2 key problems block this vision. First: tools + apps today obsessively focus on narrow tasks. Our hunch is the opposite is required: holistic design, where everything happens in one place. 

      </p>

      <p>
      However, a fluid tool without content is of no use: the second barrier is data lockin. Our data is locked across many silos because the "free" digital services we use are designed to 
        <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/08/advertising-is-the-internets-original-sin/376041/
          " target="_blank">
          monetize the content</a>
          we create. These systems 
          make it hard for us to easily search and remix our creative raw material, and compromise our privacy.

          <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/21/information/the-future-of-the-web-is-100-years-old" target="_blank">Early visionaries had something different in mind</a>, 
          and many 
          <a href="https://indiewebcamp.com/principles" target="_blank">communities</a>
          today are thinking + working deeply on a new wave of
          <a href="https://prism-break.org/en/all/" target="_blank">independent projects</a>,
          to reverse these trends of recentralization + monetization. 

          Ideas of a

          <a href="http://www.xanadu.com.au/ted/XUsurvey/xuDation.html" target="_blank">which gave us vision</a>
          but unfortunately

        The experience is our starting point for thinking differently how to change the status quo, and so we ask:

        what does a fun, inspiring home for our digital stuff look like, that easily enables our creativity to flow?
        and how can it be designed without sacrificing our privacy?
      </p>     


    </div>

    <div class="about__section">
      <h1>Who are we?</h1>

      <p>
        We're a community of <a href="https://hackpad.com/Parallels-Community-XGzlw9Mxg39" target="_blank">designers, developers, artists + researchers</a>, looking for collaborators from a broad group of backgrounds + domains: art, design, sound, psychology, security, privacy, neuroscience, video gaming, film, engineering, writing and education. This extends not just around discipline, but also on a personal level -- we're looking to actively build an inclusive, diverse group from the beginning.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="about__section">
      <h1>How?</h1>

      <p>
        Open source languages, systems and frameworks are our primary toolset. We're also pushing ourselves with our process: how we collaborate + exercise transparency. We
        believe stealth mode is generally a fallacy: we've gotten this far by sharing what we're doing with as many people as possible.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond transparency is a bigger issue: sustainability. We're not quite sure about the details but we know what we <b
          class="caps">won't</b> do: sell what we make. Sell people's data. Sell ads. These are not models of sustainability we're looking to explore.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rather, we're inspired by
        <a href="http://blog.ghost.org/year-2/" target="_blank">Ghost.org</a>,
        <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/" target="_blank">Mozilla</a>
        <a href="https://spideroak.com/features/private-by-design" target="_blank">SpiderOak</a>,
        and other organizations + projects who value transparency + data privacy. 
        Our goal is to create a non-profit organization and run a crowdfunding campaign for short term funds, and explore direct donation models later, where
        benefactors (you!) support the project via micro-donations.
      </p>

      <p>
        We don't yet know exactly how this will work, but lots of interesting things are happening: forward thinking
        non-profits are <a
          href="http://suegardner.org/2013/10/20/whats-really-wrong-with-nonprofits-and-how-we-can-fix-it"
          target="_blank">starting to think differently</a> about how to effectively
        <a href="http://suegardner.org/2014/11/30/whats-wrong-with-restricted-grants/" target="_blank">raise money</a>,
        and a 
        <a href="http://blog.ascribe.io/creative-commons-and-ascribe-enable-copyleft-on-the-bitcoin-blockchain/"
           target="_blank">new wave of digital currency platforms</a>
        are giving us a lot of ideas + leads.
      </p>

      <p>
        For now, we're focused on designing a wonderful experience, and sticking to our core principles to guide us as
        we iterate.
      </p>

    <div class="about__section">
      <h1>How is this different than the rest?</h1>

      <p>4 key design principles guide our design + vision:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b><i class="fa fa-paper-plane fa__leading-li"></i> Flow</b>, the prerequisite for creativity: an environment without barriers, and designed with encouragement to play: infinite undo/redo. Always remember where you left off. Fun.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b> <i class="fa fa-adjust fa__leading-li"></i> Remixability</b>, because everything is a remix. Anything can be assembled + broken apart, recombined,
          rearranged - just like digital Lego.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b><i class="fa fa-unlink fa__leading-li"></i> Connections</b>, use the power of association (aka, tagging + links) to
          organize your ideas. Search your stuff in ways you've never done before, and discover new ideas from others
          where you least expect it.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b><i class="fa fa-briefcase fa__leading-li"></i> Private by design</b>, Your data is yours, by default. Free thinking requires freedom from scrutiny. You own it, and no one can access it unless you explicitly publish it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      </p>
    </div>


    <div class="about__section">
      <h1>What would I use this for?</h1>

      <p>

          Are you
        <ul>
          <li>looking to keep an ongoing collection of your notes + ideas, in context of your web history + research?</li>

          <li>researching and writing a book over a long period of time, with more than just words for inspiration and
            reference?
          </li>

          <li>working on a class assignment, term paper or other research project, and are having trouble compiling bits +
            pieces from many places, including your social media profiles?
          </li>

          <li>making a presentation for work, but are having trouble crafting a coherent narrative?</li>

          <li>trying to organize a body of research, but frustrated with current diagramming tools that feel too much like
            engineering-like flowcharts?
          </li>

          <li>struggling to brainstorm with friends or coworkers on a project, and are looking for a shared digital space
            that you can move back and forth between working individually and simultaneously?
          </li>

          <li>researching + designing a film? a play? a comic? a book? or other narrative where Google docs just isn't
            cutting it?
          </li>


        </ul>

        <br>

        <p>
          See a pattern? We're all storytellers in one way or another; struggling to make sense of fragmented bits of information during work + play. How would you use Make Parallels? <a href="http://www.twitter.com/makeparallels" target="_blank">Tell us!</a>

    <div class="about__section">

      <h1>When?</h1>

      <p>
        As opposed to a hard release date, we've set up the foundational infrastructure enabling us
        to experiment + iterate. . 
      </p>

      <p>
        We've chosen a set of capabilities to loosely define our alpha milestone, which you can read more about on the <b>canvas alpha</b> column of our 
          <i class="fa fa-trello fa__inline"></i> <a href="https://trello.com/b/XtenDuNO/parallels-roadmap" target="_blank">
          task</a> board. We see these as the core which overlaps across a wide variety of use cases, and the required aspects that will sum up to an impactful + useful experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          With this early, working base, just enough to start playing with, we're reaching out to our community of over 350+ early adopters for feedback + validation. Once we have a clearer picture of where we are, we'll run a crowdfunding campaign to take us into the beta stage and beyond.
        </p>

         <p>
          Throughout this process, we're looking for fiscal sponsors + partners who see potential
          in our vision, and align with how we work + our core principles.
          Our long term goal is to fund the project directly from people using and benefitting from it.
      </p>

    <div class="about__section">
      
      <a name="privacy"></a>

      <h1>Privacy Notice</h1>
      <p>
        For our alpha release, we're currently leaning towards releasing Make Parallels as a desktop app, where all the data is only accessible to you, on your own computer. 
      </p>

      <p>
        This proof-of-concept is only a playground, meant to communicate the core ideas of our direction.
        It runs on a traditional web server: content is stored on a Heroku cloud server instance, and images are stored on an Amazon S3 server instance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Please only upload images or content that you are ok with being public- as any action you've taken (like upload an image, create a bit) can be accessed/undone via our infinite undo capability. This is by design, as our project aims to be a <a href="http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/5/186024-managing-your-digital-life/fulltext" target="_blank">PIMS</a>. If you accidentally uploaded sensitive information and would like to remove it, please <a href="mailto:steven@parallels.io">contact us</a> and we'll remove it manually from our databases.
